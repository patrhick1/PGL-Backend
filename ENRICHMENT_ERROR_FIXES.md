# Enrichment Error Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Episode Query Method
**Error**: `module 'podcast_outreach.database.queries.episodes' has no attribute 'get_episodes_for_media'`

**Location**: `podcast_outreach/services/enrichment/host_confidence_verifier.py:126`

**Fix**: Changed the method call from `get_episodes_for_media` to `get_episodes_for_media_paginated` which is the correct function name in the episodes module.

```python
# Before
episodes = await episode_queries.get_episodes_for_media(media_id, limit=10)

# After  
episodes = await episode_queries.get_episodes_for_media_paginated(media_id, offset=0, limit=10)
```

### 2. JSON String Parsing Error
**Error**: `'str' object has no attribute 'items'`

**Location**: `podcast_outreach/services/business_logic/enhanced_discovery_workflow.py:314`

**Issue**: The `host_names_discovery_confidence` field from the database was being returned as a JSON string but the code expected a dictionary.

**Fix**: Added JSON parsing and type checking before attempting to use dictionary methods:

```python
# Added JSON parsing
host_confidence = media.get('host_names_discovery_confidence', {})

# Handle case where host_confidence might be a JSON string
if isinstance(host_confidence, str):
    try:
        host_confidence = json.loads(host_confidence)
    except:
        host_confidence = {}

if host_confidence and isinstance(host_confidence, dict):
    # Now safe to call .items()
    sorted_hosts = sorted(
        host_confidence.items(),
        key=lambda x: x[1],
        reverse=True
    )
```

## Files Modified

1. **podcast_outreach/services/enrichment/host_confidence_verifier.py**
   - Fixed episode query method name

2. **podcast_outreach/services/business_logic/enhanced_discovery_workflow.py**
   - Added JSON import
   - Added JSON parsing for host confidence data
   - Added better error logging with stack traces

## Testing

Created two test scripts to verify the fixes:

1. **test_enrichment_fixes.py** - Full integration test
2. **test_simple_enrichment_fixes.py** - Simpler unit tests

Run the simple test to verify the fixes:
```bash
python -m test_simple_enrichment_fixes
```

## Impact

These fixes ensure:
- Host confidence verification can properly query episode data
- AI description generation handles JSON data correctly from the database
- Better error handling and logging for future debugging
