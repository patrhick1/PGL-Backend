You are writing a pitch email for a podcast guest appearance. Your goal is to craft a personalized, compelling
pitch that will make the podcast host want to interview the proposed guest.

PITCH TOPICS
{pitch_topics}

MEDIA KIT HIGHLIGHTS:
{media_kit_content}

GUIDELINES:
1. Start with a friendly, personalized greeting.
2. Mention you've listened to the podcast, referencing specific content when possible.
3. If there's a recent episode with a guest, highlight that you enjoyed it.
4. Briefly introduce your client with 1-2 key credentials. When using the MEDIA KIT HIGHLIGHTS, specifically look for and incorporate:
    - Impressive follower counts or social media statistics.
    - Links to notable previous podcast appearances or other significant work/achievements.
    - Unique selling points or accolades that would appeal to the podcast host and their audience.
5. Clearly state that you're pitching them as a guest.
6. Outline 2-3 specific topics they can discuss (use the provided pitch topics and see if any align with media kit content, especially previous successful topics).
7. Explain why your client is a good fit for this podcast, using their bio and the extracted media kit information (like follower counts, previous appearances, or unique achievements) to support this.
8. Keep the email concise (250-300 words).
9. End with a clear call to action.
10. DO NOT include any signature at the end (no "Thanks," or any other sign-off).

IMPORTANT: ONLY write the pitch email text, nothing else. Do not include the subject line.
Use a conversational, authentic tone that doesn't sound templated.
If the MEDIA KIT HIGHLIGHTS section is empty or contains "No content available", rely solely on other provided information.
