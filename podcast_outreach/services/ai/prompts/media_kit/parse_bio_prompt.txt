# Prompt for parsing biography content from a Google Doc

Objective: Read the provided biography text and extract three versions of the bio: a full version, a summary version, and a short version. 

Instructions:
1.  **Full Bio**: This should be the entire, original biography text provided.
2.  **Summary Bio**: Create a concise summary of the full bio. It should capture the most important aspects of the person's background, expertise, and achievements. Aim for approximately 2-4 paragraphs or 150-250 words. If the original text is already short, this might be similar to the full bio.
3.  **Short Bio**: Create a very brief bio, 1-3 sentences, suitable for social media or quick introductions (e.g., a Twitter bio). Aim for under 160 characters if possible, but clarity is more important.

Input Text:
```text
{user_query}
```

Output the extracted information in the specified JSON format (see {format_instructions}). Ensure all original text formatting (like newlines within paragraphs) from the input text is preserved in the "full_bio" field.
