# Prompt for parsing talking points from Google Doc content

Objective: Read the provided text, which contains a list of talking points or campaign angles. Identify each distinct talking point and extract its core components: topic, outcome, and description.

Instructions:
1.  Each talking point should be treated as a separate item.
2.  For each talking point, identify:
    *   **topic**: The main subject or title of the talking point. This should be concise.
    *   **outcome**: (Optional) If mentioned, what is the key takeaway, benefit, or result for the audience related to this topic? If not explicitly stated, this can be omitted or inferred if clear.
    *   **description**: A more detailed explanation or elaboration of the talking point. This should provide context and substance.
3.  The input text might have various formats (bullet points, numbered lists, paragraphs per point). Adapt to identify distinct points.
4.  If the text seems to be a single block describing one overarching theme, try to break it into 2-5 sub-topics if logically possible, otherwise, treat the whole as one talking point with a comprehensive description.

Input Text:
```text
{user_query}
```

Output a list of talking points in the specified JSON format (see {format_instructions}). Focus on capturing the essence of each point accurately.
