# Race Condition Fixes - Final Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. SQL Syntax Error in Cleanup Functions ✅
**Problem**: PostgreSQL interval syntax error: `syntax error at or near "$1"`

**Root Cause**: Invalid syntax `INTERVAL $1 * INTERVAL '1 minute'`

**Fix Applied**: Changed to PostgreSQL-compatible syntax `($1 || ' minutes')::interval`

**Files Updated**:
- `database/queries/campaign_media_discoveries.py`
  - `cleanup_stale_ai_description_locks()` (line 482)
  - `cleanup_stale_vetting_locks()` (line 508)

### 2. Wrong Vetting Orchestrator Being Used ✅
**Problem**: System was using `VettingOrchestrator` instead of `EnhancedVettingOrchestrator`

**Impact**: Vetting pipeline wasn't processing campaign_media_discoveries records

**Fix Applied**: Updated all references to use `EnhancedVettingOrchestrator`

**Files Updated**:
- `services/business_logic/enrichment_processing.py`
  - Updated imports (lines 6, 128)
  - Updated instantiations (lines 136, 183)
  - Updated log messages and comments

### 3. URL Validation Error (Previously Fixed) ✅
**Problem**: Email addresses stored in URL fields causing validation errors

**Fix**: Added data cleaning in multiple locations to move emails to appropriate fields

## Current Workflow Status

### AI Description Completion Task
- Runs every 10 minutes
- Uses atomic work acquisition with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`
- Processes up to 20 discoveries per run
- Cleans up stale locks before processing
- Releases locks after processing (success or failure)

### Enhanced Vetting Pipeline
- Now correctly processes campaign_media_discoveries
- Uses atomic work acquisition to prevent duplicates
- Cleans up stale locks before processing
- Automatically creates match suggestions for high scores (≥6.0)
- Publishes events for notifications

### Race Condition Protection
1. **Database Level**: `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` prevents duplicate processing
2. **Application Level**: Semaphores limit concurrent execution
3. **Lock Management**: Automatic cleanup of stale locks
4. **Event-Driven**: Proper event publishing for workflow continuation

## Monitoring Commands

```sql
-- Check AI description processing status
SELECT id, media_id, enrichment_error, updated_at
FROM campaign_media_discoveries
WHERE enrichment_error LIKE 'PROCESSING:AI_DESC:%'
ORDER BY updated_at DESC;

-- Check vetting processing status
SELECT id, media_id, vetting_error, vetting_status, updated_at
FROM campaign_media_discoveries
WHERE vetting_error LIKE 'PROCESSING:VETTING:%'
ORDER BY updated_at DESC;

-- Check pipeline health
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE enrichment_status = 'completed' AND vetting_status = 'pending' AND m.ai_description IS NULL) as needs_ai_desc,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE enrichment_status = 'completed' AND vetting_status = 'pending' AND m.ai_description IS NOT NULL) as ready_for_vetting,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE vetting_status = 'completed' AND vetting_score >= 5.0 AND NOT match_created) as ready_for_match
FROM campaign_media_discoveries cmd
JOIN media m ON cmd.media_id = m.media_id;
```

## Next Steps
1. Monitor logs to ensure SQL syntax fix is working
2. Verify enhanced vetting pipeline is finding and processing discoveries
3. Confirm AI descriptions are being generated within 10 minutes
4. Check that matches are being created for high-scoring vettings

## Deployment Notes
- No database schema changes required
- Services will pick up changes on restart
- Background tasks will start using new logic immediately
