## LLM Prompt Engineering

### Keyword Generation Prompt
```
Based on the following client questionnaire data, generate exactly 20 relevant keywords that represent their expertise, topics, and areas of knowledge. 

These keywords should:
- Be specific to their actual expertise (not generic)
- Include industry terms, topics they can speak about on a podcast
- Represent their unique value proposition
```

### Bio Generation Prompt
```
Based on the following client questionnaire data, create two versions of their professional bio for podcast media kits:

1. LONG BIO (150-250 words): Comprehensive, detailed bio suitable for detailed show notes
2. SHORT BIO (50-75 words): Concise version for quick introductions

Guidelines:
- Write in third person
- Include key credentials, expertise, and achievements
- Make it podcast-friendly and engaging
- Focus on what makes them valuable to audiences
- Include specific accomplishments when available
```

### Talking Points Generation Prompt
```
Based on the following client questionnaire data, create 8-12 compelling talking points/topics for podcast appearances. Each topic should be:
- Specific and actionable
- Valuable to podcast audiences
- Based on their actual expertise
- Include a brief description of what they can discuss
```

## Enhanced Error Handling

### Robust Fallbacks
