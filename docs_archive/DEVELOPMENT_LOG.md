# Development Log - PGL Podcast Outreach System

## 2025-06-21 - Pitch Generation Fixes

### Session 1: Initial Pitch Generation Errors
**Issues Found:**
1. `AttributeError: module 'podcast_outreach.services.ai.tracker' has no attribute 'log_usage'`
   - Fixed: Changed import from `tracker as ai_tracker` to `tracker.tracker as ai_tracker`

2. `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable`
   - Fixed: Added null-safe string slicing with `(get('field') or '')[:500]`

3. Vector embedding parsing errors
   - Fixed: Added conversion from PostgreSQL vector strings to numpy arrays in:
     - `episodes.py`: `get_episodes_for_media_with_embeddings()`
     - `campaigns.py`: `get_campaign_by_id()`

### Session 2: Template and Data Issues
**Issues Found:**
1. Template format mismatch - `{{placeholder}}` vs `{placeholder}`
   - Created `enhanced_generator.py` with template conversion
   - Updated templates with `setup_pitch_templates_v2.py`

2. F-string syntax errors (extra `}` characters)
   - Fixed in lines 268 and 592

3. `TypeError: sequence item 0: expected str instance, NoneType found`
   - Fixed: Used `or ''` pattern instead of `.get('field', '')`
   - Added defensive `str()` conversion

4. Google Docs integration issues
   - Campaign bio/angles are Google Docs URLs, not content
   - Fixed: Properly fetch content using `GoogleDocsService`
   - Added error handling and logging

### Session 3: Content Truncation
**Improvements:**
- Removed all input truncations (was limiting to 500-1000 chars)
- Increased model output tokens from 2000 to 4000
- Now passes full content for better context

## Current Status
The enhanced pitch generator (`enhanced_generator.py`) now:
- ✅ Properly fetches content from Google Docs
- ✅ Handles all data types (None, URLs, text)
- ✅ Uses full content without truncation
- ✅ Matches campaign angles to podcast content
- ✅ Has proper error handling and logging

## Files Modified
- `/podcast_outreach/services/pitches/generator.py` - Fixed AI tracker import
- `/podcast_outreach/services/pitches/enhanced_generator.py` - New enhanced version
- `/podcast_outreach/database/queries/episodes.py` - Added embedding parsing
- `/podcast_outreach/database/queries/campaigns.py` - Added embedding parsing
- `/podcast_outreach/database/queries/match_suggestions.py` - Use enhanced generator
- `/podcast_outreach/scripts/setup_pitch_templates_v2.py` - Update templates

## Next Steps
- Test the complete workflow with real data
- Monitor logs for any remaining issues
- Consider adding more sophisticated angle matching
