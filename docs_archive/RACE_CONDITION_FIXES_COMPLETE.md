# Race Condition Protection - Complete Implementation ✅

## All Gaps Fixed

### 1. ✅ **Vetting Pipeline Now Uses Atomic Locking**
**File**: `enhanced_vetting_orchestrator.py` (line 46)
- Changed from: `get_discoveries_ready_for_vetting()`
- Changed to: `acquire_vetting_work_batch()`
- Result: Vetting pipeline now uses `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` preventing duplicate processing

### 2. ✅ **Added Vetting Lock Cleanup**
**File**: `campaign_media_discoveries.py` (lines 497-521)
- Added: `cleanup_stale_vetting_locks()` function
- Cleans up locks older than 60 minutes
- Resets vetting_status back to 'pending' if stuck
- Called at start of each vetting pipeline run

### 3. ✅ **Fixed Default Task Registration**
**File**: `task_scheduler.py` (line 328)
- Uncommented: `scheduler.register_default_tasks()`
- All scheduled tasks now automatically start on app startup
- Includes the new AI description completion task

### 4. ✅ **Enhanced Vetting Orchestrator Updates**
**File**: `enhanced_vetting_orchestrator.py` (lines 39-42)
- Added stale lock cleanup before processing
- Uses atomic work acquisition
- Logs cleanup activity for monitoring

## Complete Protection Stack

### Database Level (Primary)
```sql
-- Atomic work acquisition with row-level locking
FOR UPDATE OF cmd SKIP LOCKED
```

### Application Level (Secondary)
```python
# Semaphore controls
'ai_description_completion': asyncio.Semaphore(1)
'vetting_pipeline': asyncio.Semaphore(1)

# Task tracking
if task_name in self.running_tasks and not self.running_tasks[task_name].done():
    logger.info(f"Task {task_name} is already running, skipping")
```

### Resource Management
```python
# API concurrency limiting
semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(3)  # Max 3 concurrent AI calls

# Timeout protection
await asyncio.wait_for(gather(*tasks), timeout=45 * 60)
```

## Monitoring Queries

### Check Active Processing
```sql
-- AI Description locks
SELECT id, media_id, enrichment_error, updated_at
FROM campaign_media_discoveries
WHERE enrichment_error LIKE 'PROCESSING:AI_DESC:%'
ORDER BY updated_at DESC;

-- Vetting locks
SELECT id, media_id, vetting_error, vetting_status, updated_at
FROM campaign_media_discoveries
WHERE vetting_error LIKE 'PROCESSING:VETTING:%'
ORDER BY updated_at DESC;
```

### Check Pipeline Health
```sql
-- Discoveries stuck without AI descriptions
SELECT COUNT(*) as needs_ai_desc
FROM campaign_media_discoveries cmd
JOIN media m ON cmd.media_id = m.media_id
WHERE cmd.enrichment_status = 'completed'
AND cmd.vetting_status = 'pending'
AND m.ai_description IS NULL;

-- Discoveries ready for vetting
SELECT COUNT(*) as ready_for_vetting
FROM campaign_media_discoveries cmd
JOIN media m ON cmd.media_id = m.media_id
WHERE cmd.enrichment_status = 'completed'
AND cmd.vetting_status = 'pending'
AND m.ai_description IS NOT NULL;
```

## System Benefits

1. **Zero Duplicate Work**: Database locks ensure only one worker processes each record
2. **Automatic Recovery**: Stale locks cleaned up every run
3. **Resource Protection**: Limited concurrent AI calls prevent cost overruns
4. **Full Pipeline Flow**: AI descriptions generated → Vetting completed → Matches created
5. **10-Minute Resolution**: Missing AI descriptions fixed within 10 minutes max
