# Chatbot Conversation Flow with LinkedIn Integration

## Expected Flow Scenarios

### Scenario 1: User Provides LinkedIn Early ✅ (OPTIMAL PATH)

```
BOT: "Hi there! I'm excited to help you create an amazing media kit. To get started, what's your full name and email address?"

USER: "John Doe, john@example.com"

BOT: "Great! Do you have a LinkedIn profile? If yes, please share your LinkedIn URL - I can analyze it to learn more about your expertise and save us both time!"

USER: "Yes, here's my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/johndoe"

BOT: "I see you've shared your LinkedIn profile! Let me analyze it quickly to learn more about your expertise... This will just take a moment."
[LinkedIn Analysis Running... ~10-15 seconds]

BOT: "What about other social media or your website? Please share any Twitter, website, or other professional links you'd like in your media kit."

USER: "My website is johndoe.com"

## Key Integration Points

### 1. LinkedIn Detection
- Occurs after user provides contact info (message #2)
- NLP processor extracts LinkedIn URL from socialMedia array
- Triggers async analysis if URL found and not already analyzed

### 2. Processing Flow
```
User provides LinkedIn URL
    ↓
Bot acknowledges and shows processing message
    ↓
LinkedIn Analyzer runs (10-15 seconds)
    ├─ Apify scrapes profile
    └─ Gemini analyzes data
    ↓
Data merged into extracted_data
    ↓
Success/Error message shown
    ↓
Questions adapt based on LinkedIn data
```

### 3. Question Adaptation

**Questions Skipped with LinkedIn:**
- ❌ "Can you tell me briefly what you do professionally?"
- ❌ "What would you say are your top 3-5 areas of expertise?"
- ❌ "What makes your approach unique?"
- ❌ "How many years have you been in your field?"

**Questions Enhanced with LinkedIn:**
- ✅ "Based on your expertise in [X, Y, Z], what's one counterintuitive insight?"
- ✅ "I see from your LinkedIn... Can you share specific metrics?"
- ✅ More targeted, specific questions based on profile content

### 4. Progress Tracking
- Base progress calculation from data completeness
- +15% bonus if LinkedIn analyzed successfully
- Early completion possible at 8 messages (vs 10) with LinkedIn

### 5. Data Priority
1. User-provided data (highest priority)
2. LinkedIn-extracted data (fills gaps)
3. AI-inferred data (lowest priority)

## Success Indicators

✅ **LinkedIn URL detected and processed**
✅ **Processing message shown during analysis**

✅ **Questions skip redundant information**
✅ **Progress jumps by 15% with LinkedIn**
✅ **Conversation completes faster (8-10 vs 15-20 messages)**

## Error Handling
