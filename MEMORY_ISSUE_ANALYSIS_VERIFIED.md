# Memory Issue Analysis - VERIFIED - PGL Backend

## Executive Summary
After thorough verification of the codebase, the memory issues identified in the original analysis are mostly accurate. Some cleanup mechanisms exist but key problems remain unaddressed.

## Verification Results

### 1. **Temporary File Cleanup** ⚠️ PARTIALLY FIXED

#### What EXISTS:
- ✅ Context manager `temp_audio_file()` with proper cleanup (lines 53-68)
- ✅ The `transcribe_audio()` method has proper cleanup in finally block (lines 493-501)
- ✅ Batch transcriber has double cleanup safety (lines 388-395)

#### What's MISSING:
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: `_download_audio_sync()` does NOT use try/finally for cleanup
- ❌ Cleanup only happens in specific error cases (404, 403) but not for general exceptions
- ❌ If download succeeds but later processing fails, temp file from download isn't cleaned

**VERDICT**: The analysis was correct - download method lacks proper cleanup structure.

### 2. **Memory Checks Before Processing** ✅ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

#### What EXISTS:
- ✅ `@memory_guard` decorator on `_process_long_audio()` (line 373)
- ✅ Memory check before loading large files (lines 377-379)
- ✅ `cleanup_memory()` called after processing chunks (line 397)
- ✅ `del audio` to free AudioSegment memory (line 396)

#### What's MISSING:
- ⚠️ Memory threshold is 80% - too high for cloud environments
- ❌ No memory checks in batch processing before starting new batches
- ❌ No memory checks in main `transcribe_audio()` method

**VERDICT**: Basic memory protection exists but threshold is too high.

### 3. **File Size Checks** ❌ CONFIRMED ISSUE

#### What EXISTS:
- ✅ File size check AFTER download (lines 451-458)
- ✅ MAX_FILE_SIZE = 500MB limit enforced

#### What's MISSING:
- ❌ No HEAD request to check size before download
- ❌ File is fully downloaded into memory/disk before size check
- ❌ Wasted bandwidth and memory on oversized files

**VERDICT**: The analysis was 100% correct - no pre-download size validation.

### 4. **Concurrency Coordination** ❌ CONFIRMED ISSUE

#### What EXISTS:
- ✅ Individual semaphores:
  - `_gemini_api_semaphore` in transcriber (line 88)
  - Task-specific semaphores in scheduler (lines 47-55)
  - MAX_BATCH_SIZE in batch transcriber (line 34)

#### What's MISSING:
- ❌ No global semaphore coordinating all transcription operations
- ❌ Each service can run independently, multiplying memory usage
- ❌ Total concurrent operations can be: batch(5) × chunks(2) + scheduler(2) = 12

**VERDICT**: The analysis was correct - no global coordination exists.

### 5. **Cache Cleanup** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

#### What EXISTS:
- ✅ `_periodic_cache_cleanup()` runs every hour (lines 590-621)
- ✅ Cleans batches older than 24 hours
- ✅ Cleans failed URLs older than 7 days
- ✅ Proper background task with error handling

**VERDICT**: This was incorrectly identified as an issue - cleanup exists and works well.

### 6. **Memory-Aware Batch Sizing** ❌ CONFIRMED ISSUE

#### What EXISTS:
- ✅ Fixed MAX_BATCH_SIZE from environment (line 34)

#### What's MISSING:
- ❌ No dynamic adjustment based on current memory usage
- ❌ Always tries to process MAX_BATCH_SIZE regardless of memory pressure

**VERDICT**: The analysis was correct - no memory-aware sizing.

## Critical Issues That Need Immediate Attention

### 1. **Download Method Memory Leak** (HIGH PRIORITY)
The `_download_audio_sync()` method creates temp files but only cleans them up in specific error cases. Need to wrap entire method in try/finally:

```python
def _download_audio_sync(self, url: str) -> Optional[str]:
    tmp_path = None
    try:
        # ... existing download logic ...
        return tmp_path
    except Exception as e:
        # ... error handling ...
        raise
    finally:
        if tmp_path and os.path.exists(tmp_path) and not successful:
            os.remove(tmp_path)
```

### 2. **Pre-Download Size Check** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
Add HEAD request before download:

```python
# Check size first
response = session.head(url, allow_redirects=True, timeout=30)
content_length = int(response.headers.get('content-length', 0))
if content_length > MAX_FILE_SIZE:
    raise ValueError(f"File too large: {content_length / (1024*1024):.1f} MB")
```

### 3. **Global Concurrency Control** (HIGH PRIORITY)
Implement a global semaphore:

```python
# In config or initialization
GLOBAL_TRANSCRIPTION_SEMAPHORE = asyncio.Semaphore(3)

# Wrap all transcription operations
async with GLOBAL_TRANSCRIPTION_SEMAPHORE:
    # transcription logic
```

### 4. **Lower Memory Thresholds** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
Change memory_guard threshold:
- From: `@memory_guard(threshold_percent=80.0)`
- To: `@memory_guard(threshold_percent=60.0)`

### 5. **Memory-Aware Batching** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
Add dynamic batch sizing in batch_transcriber.py:

```python
def get_safe_batch_size(self):
    memory_info = get_memory_info()
    if memory_info["process_percent"] > 50:
        return 1
    elif memory_info["process_percent"] > 30:
        return min(2, self.MAX_BATCH_SIZE)
    return self.MAX_BATCH_SIZE
```

## Summary

The original MEMORY_ISSUE_ANALYSIS.md was **mostly accurate**:
- ✅ Temp file cleanup issue in download method - CONFIRMED
- ✅ File size check after download - CONFIRMED  
- ✅ No global concurrency control - CONFIRMED
- ✅ No memory-aware batch sizing - CONFIRMED
- ✅ High memory thresholds - CONFIRMED
- ❌ Cache cleanup missing - INCORRECT (it exists and works)

The main issues causing memory problems are:
1. Temp files not cleaned up on download failures
2. Large files downloaded before size check
3. Uncoordinated concurrent operations
4. Fixed batch sizes regardless of memory state

These issues compound when processing multiple large audio files concurrently, leading to the memory limit exceeded errors on Render.
