# Memory Fix Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented all critical memory fixes identified in the MEMORY_ISSUE_ANALYSIS_VERIFIED.md document to address the Render memory limit exceeded errors.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Download Method Memory Leak (HIGH PRIORITY) ✅
**File**: `podcast_outreach/services/media/transcriber.py`
- Added `download_successful` flag to track completion
- Wrapped entire download method in try/finally block
- Ensured temp files are ALWAYS cleaned up on failure
- Fixed the critical issue where temp files accumulated on errors

### 2. Added Pre-Download File Size Check (MEDIUM PRIORITY) ✅
**File**: `podcast_outreach/services/media/transcriber.py`
- Added HEAD request before download to check Content-Length
- Prevents downloading files larger than MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB
- Saves bandwidth and memory by rejecting large files early
- Uses environment variable MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB (default: 500MB)

### 3. Implemented Global Concurrency Control (HIGH PRIORITY) ✅
**File**: `podcast_outreach/services/media/transcriber.py`
- Added `GLOBAL_TRANSCRIPTION_SEMAPHORE` at module level
- Limits total concurrent transcriptions across all services
- Wrapped `transcribe_audio()` method with the semaphore
- Uses environment variable GLOBAL_TRANSCRIPTION_LIMIT (default: 3)

### 4. Lowered Memory Thresholds (MEDIUM PRIORITY) ✅
**Files**: 
- `podcast_outreach/services/media/transcriber.py`
- `podcast_outreach/utils/memory_monitor.py`

Changes:
- Changed memory_guard decorator threshold from 80% to 60%
- Updated check_memory_usage() to fail at 60% (was 80%)
- Updated warning threshold from 60% to 40%
- Better suited for cloud environments with limited memory

### 5. Implemented Memory-Aware Batch Sizing (MEDIUM PRIORITY) ✅
**File**: `podcast_outreach/services/media/batch_transcriber.py`
- Added `get_safe_batch_size()` method
- Dynamically adjusts batch size based on current memory usage:
  - Memory > 50%: batch size = 1
  - Memory 30-50%: batch size = 2
  - Memory < 30%: batch size = MAX_BATCH_SIZE
- Updated `_create_smart_batches()` to use memory-aware sizing
- Re-checks memory between batches for adaptive sizing

## Environment Variable Updates Required

Add/update these environment variables in your deployment:

```env
# Existing (verify these are set)
CHUNK_CONCURRENCY=2
GEMINI_API_CONCURRENCY=2
MAX_BATCH_SIZE=3

# New variables
MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=300          # Maximum file size to download (MB)
GLOBAL_TRANSCRIPTION_LIMIT=3  # Total concurrent transcriptions allowed
```

## Expected Impact

1. **Memory Leak Prevention**: Temp files will always be cleaned up, preventing disk space exhaustion
2. **Reduced Memory Spikes**: Large files rejected before download
3. **Controlled Concurrency**: Maximum 3 transcriptions running simultaneously (down from potential 12)
4. **Early Memory Protection**: Operations blocked at 60% memory usage instead of 80%
5. **Adaptive Processing**: Batch sizes automatically reduced when memory is high

## Monitoring Recommendations

1. Monitor memory usage patterns after deployment
2. Check logs for "HIGH MEMORY USAGE" and "memory-aware batch size" messages
3. Verify temp file cleanup with: `ls -la /tmp | grep -E "(mp3|wav|m4a|flac)"`
4. Consider adjusting thresholds based on your Render instance size

## Next Steps

1. Deploy these changes to your Render environment
2. Update environment variables as specified above
3. Monitor memory usage for 24-48 hours
4. Fine-tune thresholds if needed based on actual usage patterns
