  - Exponential backoff with configurable delay (default: 60 seconds)
  - Campaign status tracking throughout processing lifecycle
  - Graceful handling of stop signals during retries
  - Comprehensive error logging and status updates

## Data Flow Architecture

### 1. Questionnaire Submission Flow
```
Client Questionnaire → QuestionnaireProcessor → Enhanced Content Processing → Media Kit Generation
                                          ↓
                               Podcast URL Processing → Transcription → Analysis
```

### 2. Bio Generation Priority Flow
```
1. Questionnaire Data + Podcast Insights → LLM Bio Generation
   ↓ (if fails)
2. GDoc Bio → Parse and Structure
   ↓ (if fails)
3. Person Database Bio → Format
   ↓ (if fails)
4. Fallback Message
```

### 3. Background Processing Flow
```
Questionnaire Submission → Queue Background Task → Content Processing (with retries)
                                                        ↓
                                              Media Kit Generation → Match Creation
```

## Key Technical Improvements

### 1. Flexible JSON Questionnaire Structure
- Supports dynamic questionnaire formats without rigid schema constraints
- Enhanced parsing and validation for different data types
- Graceful handling of missing or malformed data

### 2. Enhanced LLM Integration
- Improved prompts for podcast-specific bio generation
- Better context building from multiple questionnaire sections
- Integration of speaking insights from podcast transcriptions

### 3. Podcast Transcription Integration
- Automatic processing of podcast URLs provided in questionnaires
- Speaking style analysis and expertise extraction
- Integration of insights into bio generation process

### 4. Robust Error Handling
- Comprehensive retry mechanisms with configurable parameters
- Status tracking for all processing stages
- Graceful degradation with meaningful fallbacks

## Configuration and Usage

### 1. Questionnaire Data Structure
The system accepts flexible JSON structures with the following recommended sections:
- `contactInfo`: Basic contact information
- `professionalBio`: Work background and expertise
- `suggestedTopics`: Preferred podcast topics and key messages
- `socialProof`: Testimonials and notable statistics
- `promotionPrefs`: Promotion preferences and items to highlight
- `podcastUrls`: List of past podcast appearances for transcription

### 2. Error Handling Configuration
```python
# Background task retry configuration
max_retries = 3          # Number of retry attempts
retry_delay = 60.0       # Delay between retries in seconds
```

### 3. Bio Generation Priority
The system automatically follows the priority order without configuration needed. Each level provides fallback to the next if unsuccessful.

## Integration Points
