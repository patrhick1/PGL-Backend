# Multiple Pitches Per Match - Detailed Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

Enable users to create multiple pitch sequences (initial email, follow-ups) for the same campaign-media match. The solution uses campaign_id + media_id as the natural grouping key, with sequence numbers to track pitch order, eliminating the need for additional relationship fields.

## Current System Analysis

### Database Structure

#### Key Tables
1. **match_suggestions**: Links campaigns to media (podcasts)
   - Primary Key: `match_id`
   - Key Fields: `campaign_id`, `media_id`, `client_approved`
   - When `client_approved = TRUE`, the match is ready for pitch generation

2. **pitch_generations**: Stores pitch content
   - Primary Key: `pitch_gen_id`
   - Key Fields: `campaign_id`, `media_id`, `draft_text`, `final_text`, `send_ready_bool`
   - No direct link to `match_id` currently
   - Contains the actual email content

3. **pitches**: Tracks sending and engagement
   - Primary Key: `pitch_id`
   - Key Fields: `campaign_id`, `media_id`, `pitch_gen_id`, `attempt_no`, `pitch_state`
   - Links to pitch_generations via `pitch_gen_id`
   - Tracks: sent, opened, clicked, replied states

### Current Workflow
1. Match gets approved â†’ `client_approved = TRUE`
2. User manually creates pitch generation (no auto-generation)
3. Pitch record created linking to pitch generation
4. Email sent and tracked

### Current Limitations
- No explicit relationship between matches and pitch generations
- No structured way to handle multiple pitches per match
- `attempt_no` field exists but is underutilized
- No sequence tracking for follow-ups

## Proposed Solution

### Core Concept
Use the natural composite key of `campaign_id + media_id` to group pitches, with a `sequence_number` to track order. The first pitch (sequence_number = 1) is the initial pitch, subsequent ones are follow-ups.

### Database Changes

#### 1. Add Fields to pitch_generations Table

```sql
-- Add match_id for explicit relationship
ALTER TABLE pitch_generations 
ADD COLUMN match_id INTEGER REFERENCES match_suggestions(match_id) ON DELETE RESTRICT;

-- Add sequence tracking
ALTER TABLE pitch_generations
ADD COLUMN sequence_number INTEGER DEFAULT 1 NOT NULL;

-- Add pitch type for clarity
ALTER TABLE pitch_generations
ADD COLUMN pitch_type VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'initial' 
CHECK (pitch_type IN ('initial', 'follow_up_1', 'follow_up_2', 'follow_up_3', 'custom', 're_engagement'));

-- Add metadata for tracking
ALTER TABLE pitch_generations
ADD COLUMN pitch_metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb;

-- Create indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_pitch_generations_match_id 
ON pitch_generations(match_id);

CREATE INDEX idx_pitch_generations_campaign_media 
ON pitch_generations(campaign_id, media_id);

CREATE INDEX idx_pitch_generations_sequence 
ON pitch_generations(campaign_id, media_id, sequence_number);

-- Add comment for documentation
COMMENT ON COLUMN pitch_generations.sequence_number IS 
'Order of pitch in sequence. 1 = initial, 2+ = follow-ups. Unique per campaign-media combination.';

COMMENT ON COLUMN pitch_generations.pitch_metadata IS 
'JSON metadata: days_since_last_pitch, template_variables, automation_trigger, etc.';
```

#### 2. Create Function to Get Next Sequence Number

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_next_pitch_sequence_number(
    p_campaign_id UUID,
    p_media_id INTEGER
) RETURNS INTEGER AS $$
DECLARE
    v_max_sequence INTEGER;
BEGIN
    SELECT COALESCE(MAX(sequence_number), 0) + 1
    INTO v_max_sequence
    FROM pitch_generations
    WHERE campaign_id = p_campaign_id 
    AND media_id = p_media_id;
    
    RETURN v_max_sequence;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

#### 3. Create Function to Determine Pitch Type

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION determine_pitch_type(
    p_sequence_number INTEGER
) RETURNS VARCHAR AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN CASE 
        WHEN p_sequence_number = 1 THEN 'initial'
        WHEN p_sequence_number = 2 THEN 'follow_up_1'
        WHEN p_sequence_number = 3 THEN 'follow_up_2'
        WHEN p_sequence_number = 4 THEN 'follow_up_3'
        ELSE 'custom'
    END;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

#### 4. Add Constraint to Prevent Duplicate Sequences

```sql
-- Ensure unique sequence numbers per campaign-media combination
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_unique_campaign_media_sequence 
ON pitch_generations(campaign_id, media_id, sequence_number);
```

#### 5. Data Migration for Existing Records

```sql
-- Populate match_id for existing pitch_generations
UPDATE pitch_generations pg
SET match_id = ms.match_id,
    sequence_number = 1,
    pitch_type = 'initial'
FROM match_suggestions ms
WHERE pg.campaign_id = ms.campaign_id 
AND pg.media_id = ms.media_id
AND pg.match_id IS NULL;

-- Update attempt_no in pitches table to match sequence_number
UPDATE pitches p
SET attempt_no = pg.sequence_number
FROM pitch_generations pg
WHERE p.pitch_gen_id = pg.pitch_gen_id
AND p.attempt_no != pg.sequence_number;
```

### Frontend Implementation

#### 1. Pitch Sequence Component

```typescript

### Analytics and Reporting

#### 1. Sequence Performance Queries

```sql
-- Get pitch sequence performance metrics
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW pitch_sequence_metrics AS
SELECT 
    pg.campaign_id,
    pg.media_id,
    pg.sequence_number,
    pg.pitch_type,

    SUM(CASE WHEN p.opened_ts IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as opens,
    SUM(CASE WHEN p.clicked_ts IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as clicks,
    AVG(EXTRACT(DAY FROM p.reply_ts - p.send_ts)) as avg_reply_time_days,
    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN p.reply_bool THEN 1.0 ELSE 0.0 END) * 100, 2) as reply_rate

```

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests
```python
# tests/test_pitch_sequences.py

async def test_sequence_number_increment():
    """Test that sequence numbers increment correctly"""
    # Create initial pitch
    pitch1 = await create_pitch_generation({
        'campaign_id': test_campaign_id,
        'media_id': test_media_id,
        'draft_text': 'Initial pitch'
    })
    assert pitch1['sequence_number'] == 1
    assert pitch1['pitch_type'] == 'initial'
    
    # Create follow-up
    pitch2 = await create_pitch_generation({
        'campaign_id': test_campaign_id,
        'media_id': test_media_id,
        'draft_text': 'Follow-up 1'
    })
    assert pitch2['sequence_number'] == 2
    assert pitch2['pitch_type'] == 'follow_up_1'

async def test_follow_up_restrictions():
    """Test that follow-up creation respects business rules"""
    # Test can't create follow-up too soon
    result = await can_create_follow_up(campaign_id, media_id)
    assert result['follow_up_status'] == 'too_recent'
    
    # Test can't create follow-up after reply
    # ... etc
```

### Rollback Plan

If issues arise, rollback strategy:

```sql
-- Remove new columns
ALTER TABLE pitch_generations 
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS match_id,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS sequence_number,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS pitch_type,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS pitch_metadata;

-- Drop new indexes
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_pitch_generations_match_id;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_pitch_generations_campaign_media;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_pitch_generations_sequence;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_unique_campaign_media_sequence;

-- Drop new functions
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS get_next_pitch_sequence_number;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS determine_pitch_type;
```

### Success Metrics

1. **Adoption Rate**: % of users creating follow-ups
2. **Reply Rate Improvement**: Compare single vs multiple pitch sequences
3. **Optimal Timing**: Identify best days between follow-ups
4. **Sequence Completion**: % of sequences that reach 3+ pitches
5. **Premium Conversion**: Free users upgrading for automation

### Documentation

Update API documentation with new endpoints:
- GET `/pitches/match/{match_id}/pitch-sequence`
- POST `/pitches/match/{match_id}/create-follow-up`
- GET `/pitches/campaign/{campaign_id}/media/{media_id}/pitches`
- POST `/pitches/bulk-follow-ups`

### Security Considerations

1. **Rate Limiting**: Limit follow-up creation to prevent spam
2. **Ownership Validation**: Ensure users can only create follow-ups for their matches
3. **Sequence Limits**: Max 4 pitches per match to prevent harassment
4. **Time Restrictions**: Minimum 7 days between pitches

This implementation provides a robust, scalable solution for multiple pitches per match while maintaining backward compatibility and clear upgrade paths for premium features.
